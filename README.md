# AudioDataset

This repo contains some of the work I did to train a sound classification ML model. It includes **my own personal audio recordings** (classified by me), and some open source audio files found from various sources:

- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmoreaux/environmental-sound-classification-50
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solorzano/ambient-noise/data
- https://research.google.com/audioset////dataset/index.html

Note the actual .wav audio files are gitignored to reduce the repo size.
